# Reinforcement-Learning
Smart Diagnostics system using Reinforcement Learning  
This project is a Smart Diagnostic System that leverages Reinforcement Learning (RL) to dynamically identify medical conditions based on both common and unique symptoms. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, our model learns optimal diagnostic strategies by interacting with a simulated environment that mimics patient responses.The model can learn to ask key symptoms to differentiate diseases.

It needs a good symptom matrix, a structured action space, and a reward system that promotes fast, accurate diagnosis.
This approach scales, and becomes more intelligent over time.

The system is designed to:
Minimize diagnostic steps by prioritizing the most informative questions or tests.
Handle overlapping symptoms (e.g., fever, fatigue) that are common across diseases.
Identify rare or disease-specific symptoms (e.g., night sweats for lymphoma) to differentiate conditions.
Continuously improve its diagnostic policy using reward signals based on diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness.

Key Features:
RL agent (e.g., DQN, PPO) trained to perform sequential symptom queries.
Simulated patient environments to mimic real-world symptom variability.
Support for multiple diseases with probabilistic symptom mapping.
Prioritization of cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic steps.

Include: embedding layers, symptom unreliability, test costs, and hierarchical decisions
